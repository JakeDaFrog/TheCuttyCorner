      <p>After some chilly and dewy Winter trips, I wanted to make a more breathable and lightweight bivy to use in tandem with my trekking pole tarp for use on windy trips, or on trips where the dew points or rain calls for a bit more protection from the elements. This design was heavily inspired by the Borah bivys which I had owned previously, but I wanted to have something made by me. I took what I liked about the Borahs, and added some changes like a full seam seal, a taller overall profile (especially in the foot box to accommodate my size 13s), and a larger mesh panel at the head.</p>

      <p>This project went together with relative ease, the only hurdle being the challenging-to-work-with noseeum mesh, which was a bit of a nightmare to sew a zipper onto. After a few nights with this in the backcountry, I am pleased with it, and I often bring it as an emergency backup when the rain is a possibility to provide some splash protection under the tarp. I bought the fabric from Ripstop By The Roll and the project total was $41. The finished weight is 231 grams with the stuff sack. Below is a spreadsheet with the materials used as well as some project photos.</p>
