    <p>In December of 2025, Rhys, Drew, Chad, and I decided to take a classic winter hot springs trip. We had originally planned a coast tour for the weekend, but for the second year in a row, weather shut that plan down. Instead, the four of us packed our rigs into the truck and headed into the southern Los Padres. </p>

    <p>After a snack stop in Los Alamos, we parked off Paradise Road and set out to start the loop. The initial climb up to the Camuesa Saddle is insanely steep, but the clarity and views of the day more than made up for it. We ran into some wilderness rangers—a first for me in the LP—and they were sure to remind us that the wilderness needs protecting, too. The descent into Santa Barbara Canyon is always a treat, and the recent rain made for incredibly tacky soil. The trail had a few more slide-outs than the previous year, but overall, the conditions were lovely. After finishing the decent, we stopped to hit a classic stop at a beautiful cottonwood grove and enjoyed a cold dip.</p>
    
    <p>We arrived at the vacant hot springs stoked and immediately headed to the upper pools for a soak. The upper springs were quite warm and relatively clean thanks to some recent visits from fellow soakers. Flows were considerably higher than in 2024, and the cold plunges near the upper pools were all-time. The lower pool was a bit cooler but perfect for a long, relaxed evening soak. Later, we were joined by a pair of friends coming in from Romero Saddle, and we spent the evening talking about books and the wonders of the Channel Islands.</p>
    
    <p>The next morning, we woke up, enjoyed another soak and some breakfast, and then set off for what we thought would be a long day of climbing. The day flew by, and we decided to take the 19 Oaks Trail down from Camuesa—a great call. Once again, the recent rain had blessed the soil, creating epic conditions on an already fun trail. We reached the car in the early afternoon and were greeted by the camp hosts. Unfortunately, they had caught on to our fraudulent permit, and we had to pay the $40 overnight fee. All things considered, it was a lovely trip, as always, and a perfect way to round out another great year in the LP.</p>
