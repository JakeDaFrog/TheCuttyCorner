                <p>Footage from a weekend in September of 2023 where some friends met me at the end of a bike tour for a final night of camping and relaxing. This may be the last time I ever get to camp at this particular beach on the central coast of Califronia. This was shot on Hi8, and digitized by me.</p>

                <p>Some of the only footage I have of myself riding a mountain bike, as well as Drew riding his. This was made a few weeks before the Inaugural Escape LA bikepacking race in 2023. The second section of this video shows Drea and I going over our bikepacing rigs for the race. An in-depth recap of this trip can be found in the Trips section of this site. This was shot on Hi8, and digitized by me. </p>

                <p>An overnight bikepacking trip in San Luis Obispo county in the Fall of 2023. I was joined by Peter McBride and Drew Taylor. The three of us left from Pete and my work, and Taylor Mihelic joined us for the climb. Once we reached our camp, we enjoyed a wonderful burrito dinner as the sun went down. We descended in the morning and enjoyed a rather warm dip follewd by some coffee before the three of us went to work later that morning. This was shot on Hi8, and digitized by me. </p>
