        Welcome to thecuttycorner.com, a mostly outdoor-centered blog created Jake Jackson, and hosted on the central coast of California. This website began development in late 2024 with the goal of a homologous space for life's happenings. This website came from a desire to share, but a distaste with doing so through social media. After a few previous attempts of building a site with some of the popular tools available today, I never felt like the site design matched what I was going for. Modern website design is a bit boring, so I retreated to the even more boring ways of the old internet, as well as some of my favorite blog-style websites that still exist today. Shout out to bigsurtrailmap.net, goingslowly.com, buggulch.com, and the various homemade travel blogs for inspiring me to code this myself. This website serves as a refuge for my projects, trips, articles, and other creations that will grow with time. Enjoy.
