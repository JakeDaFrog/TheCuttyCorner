            <p>Welcome to The Cutty Corner, a mostly outdoor-centered blog by Jake Jackson. This website began development in late 2024 with the goal of a homologous space for life's happenings. This website came from a desire to share, but a distaste with doing so through social media. After a few previous attempts of building a site with some of the popular tools available today, I never felt like the site design matched what I was going for. Modern website design is a bit boring, so I retreated to the even more broing ways of the old internet, as well as some of my favroite blog-style websites that still exist today. Shout out to bigsurtrailmap.net, goingslowly.com, buggulch.com, mtbr.com, and many more for inspiring me to code this from the ground up using HTML. This website serves as a refuge for my projects, trips, artcles, and other creations that will hopefully inspire others to get out there. To get <i>cutty.</i></p>
            
            <p>This page is in the early phases of its life, so if you see something that looks awry, email thecuttycorner@gmail.com</p>
